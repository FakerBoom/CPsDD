# Case Study
![To evaluate real-world model behavior, we present a case study (See Case.pdf) where different models respond to the same user input. Both GPT-4o and human experts assessed the generated responses. CADSS scored highest for its comprehensive understanding, empathetic tone, actionable suggestions, and guiding further self-expression. GPT-4o performed well with informative and emotionally supportive content, though its verbosity may dilute engagement. CKPI showed basic understanding but lacked proactive guidance or strategic follow-ups. Qwen2.5-7B produced generic, surface-level replies with limited psychological value. This case clearly illustrates the effectiveness of CADSS’s multi-agent design.](https://github.com/FakerBoom/CPsDD/blob/main/case.png)
